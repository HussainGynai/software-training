# Exercise 3.2

Welcome to exercise 3.2. This exercise will test your ability to create and use pointers. This exercise will expect you to know all the information in the Codecademy C++ course through the References and Pointers section. Our own video on Resources, Lifetime, and Ownership is not needed but will help you get a better understanding of pointers and their use.

# Exercise Statement

In this exercise you will finish writing the code needed to create a linked list. A linked list is a data structure that holds data, similar to a vector. A linked list is made up of nodes in a line each which contains two pieces of information:
1. Whatever data you want to store in the linked list (in this case a string)
2. A pointer to the next data
However, the linked list itself does not keep track of the pointer of each piece of data, but instead only keeps track of the first, or head, node. From the head pointer it is possible to iterate through and access the entire list. You will be creating some functions that help use a linked list, this includes functions that remove data and add new data at specific locations and also one to print the whole list out.
